# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

OpenStaff is actively supported on the latest `main` branch and the latest tagged release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Use one of these channels instead:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (preferred): open a private report in the repository Security tab.
2. If Security Advisories is unavailable, open a private communication channel with the maintainers and include:
   - affected version/commit
   - reproduction steps
   - impact assessment
   - suggested mitigation (if available)

We will acknowledge receipt quickly, triage severity, and ship a fix as soon as possible.
